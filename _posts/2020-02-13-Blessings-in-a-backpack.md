**Here's a recap of what we covered on our sixth meeting:**


**What is this drive for?**
All donations from this fundraiser will go to less fortunate students at feeder schools, such as East Cobb MS, Brumby ES, East Valley ES, Powers Ferry ES, and Sedalia Park ES.

**When can I donate?**
This fundraiser will take place from **March 2-6**. No donations will be accepted afterwards.

**What items can I donate?**
Here's the full list:
- canned corn
- canned green beans
- canned black beans
- chicken noodle soup
- grits packets
- oatmeal packets
- fruit cups
- applesauce cups

**What am I required to do? What's the consequence if I don't do it?**
As a member of NHS, you are required to donate at least 5 items to our NHS collection in Ms. Sellman's room. 

**What's the difference between the raffle and the NHS donations?**
The raffle is school-wide while the requirements/hours are only for NHS members.
After the first five items have been donated to our collection, you may donate an additional 5 items for 0.5 CS hours or an additional 10 for 1 hour. In addition to this, you may donate to our school-wide raffle collection in the cafeteria to win gift cards; each 5 items get you 1 raffle ticket. Any items donated to our NHS collection for requirements/hours will not get you raffle tickets.

For instance, say I purchase 20 different items from the store. I would hypothetically give 5 of them to the NHS collection to meet my requirements, another 5 to get me 0.5 CS hours, and my last 10 to the raffle collection to get me 2 raffle tickets.

**How else can I get community service hours from this?**
In addition to donating more items to the NHS collection, we are also offering opportunities to run the tables for the raffle contest. Here's the sign-up. Each lunch session will give you 30 minutes of CS hours.

Also, we will be sending out opportunities to sort the items during the week of 3/9. Stay tuned.

**What can I win from the raffle?**
3 gift cards ($25, $15, $10) to Target! 

**Where do I donate?**
For NHS donations: **Ms. Sellman's room**
When bringing these donations, please place the items in a bag with your name somewhere. If you intend to use them for CS hours, please fill out a CS slip and place inside the bag. 
For raffle donations: Cafeteria
