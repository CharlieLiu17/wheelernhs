title: 1/22 Meeting

**Here's a recap of what we covered on our fifth meeting:**

T-shirts will be here in February. Things to keep in mind is that 4/22 is the hour deadline (check on website); soon, hourtallies will be handed out.

Your SWAW hours should be in now. If you want your hours to count toward NHS, email us.

If you are thinking of running for NHS office, applications will open in April.

The bulletin board has been rebooted! In February, the words of the month will be school spirit and integrity. Teachers can nominate you to represent the word of the month. If you are nominated you receive a certificate and a small treat :).

In colloboration with Helping Hands, East Valley Elementary school tutoring will now be available, so watch out for that opportunity in the weekly emails this semester. 

Additionally, the baby-hat-making event sponsored by Vasquez is still going on! Talk to Ms. Vasquez for more information.

**IMPORTANT:** This year we are making a big push for Blessings for a Backpack in **the last week of February (2/24).** We have decided that NHS members will have to make a **mandatory donation of 5 canned goods.** If you don't donate, there will be a penalty hour consequence. You will be able to donate specfic canned goods that are on a list that we will be sending out very soon. By March, we aim to be sorting the goods, so make sure to get in your donation in a timely fashion! You can decide to donate 5 or 10 more canned goods for 0.5 or 1 hour of community service hours, respectively. When placing goods in a bin, make sure you have a bag and a NHS slip with your canned goods. Otherwise, we won't be able to give you hours for it! _All of this is NHS information. Read the following paragraph for what your goods will mean school-wide._

**Attention: This is not part of NHS, but for BIB as a whole.** There will also be a raffle for the whole school. You can win either a $25, $15, $10 gift cards. We will be setting up a station in the cafeteria (which you can also sign up ,to help with for hours). For every 5 goods donated, you get one raffle ticket. The mandatory 5 goods for NHS do not count toward a raffle ticket.
 
Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
