title: Word of the Month Nomination
---
Good afternoon!

National Honor Society is rebooting our Word of the Month program for student recognition.  If you could take a few minutes to nominate a student for February for either A) School Spirit or B) integrity, we would appreciate it.  Students will receive a certificate and a “goodie” for your nomination.

Please use the link below to connect to the form:

Responses are due by January 31st.

Thank you so much for your participation!!
	
Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
