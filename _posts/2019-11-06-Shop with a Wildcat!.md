title: Shop With a Wildcat!
---

It's that time of the year again: Shop with a Wildcat! 

Shop with a Wildcat is a great opportunity for students to connect with lower-income communities. In teams of three or four, you accompany children to help shop at the store for what they need and for awesome holiday gifts. National Honor Society is happy to say that you can SWAW as a NHS member! We're hoping for this to be a great one this year. 

[Here's the form if you're interested](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B7bZcKLTnz9oSS01ZDVCaGd0VGRfV1FaZEVRQ0lzdGR0MVBv)

Note: To encourage engagement in the club throughout the year, doing this event will count as 3 hours. 

Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
