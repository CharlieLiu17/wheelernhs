title: 10/09 Meeting

**Here's a recap of what we covered on our second meeting:**

There's a lot of new events this week and in the following weeks! Make sure to make full use of the opportunities that you can make it to because the number of volunteering events in the future can be unpredictable. 

This week, you can sign up for help with the Word of the Month Bulletin Board, Homecoming Parade event, Homecoming Decorating, Fall Forum host by Georgia JCL, and National Spanish Honor Society hat-making (ask Vazquez). 

Note: If doing Homecoming Parade, please bring small baguettes (seriously), because our theme will be Paris.

Remember, no hours are counted until permission forms are turned in.

Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
