****CALLING ALL FUTURE DELAGATES FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR OF 2019-20!**

Welcome to Wheeler's MUN webpage! Here's a little backstory:
MUN got started back up on 2019-20 school year, so we are fairly new. Garret McDowell 
was our sponsor but sadly he left this year. However, we still have Mr. White! We competed
last year in the GT Conference and did well!

What is MUN? Model United Nations is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students can learn about diplomacy,
international relations, and the UNited Nations. 

**What we are doing now:**

We are now preparing for out GT Conference in October! This is a 2 day conference where we can compete against other schools with our chosen country or countries and committee
spot.
