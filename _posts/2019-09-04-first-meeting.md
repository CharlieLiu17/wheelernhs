**Here's a recap of what we covered on our first meeting:**

**Dues** are 20 dollars; they will only be accepted on MyPaymentsPlus. Please pay your dues ASAP, we don't want you to be on probation!

Please get your club **permission forms** signed and returned to Ms. Sellman! You cannot participate or volunteer before those are returned.

**Tutoring:** Every week sign-ups for tutoring will be sent out. The only way you can sign up is through these email links. These opportunities
are meant solely for NHS, so do intend to use these sign-ups for any other honor society or for general community service hours. Opportunities 
you'll likely be seeing will be Learning Links every Tuesday and Thursday and tutoring at Brumby and East Cobb Middle School. 

**Attendance:** Doors will always close at 7:50 sharp. Any late entries will not be recorded.

**Slips** should always be signed by an adult! No signature means no hours. Additionally, slips turned in more than a week after the actual event 
will not be counted, so make sure to get your slips in as soon as possible!

**Cheating** is strictly forbidden in National Honor Society. It is directly everything this organization stands for. 
Our policy on cheating is immediate expulsion from the organization.
