**Here's a recap of what we covered on our second meeting:**

Only 58% of members have paid dues! Have your dues in by 12/1, and you will be able to receive an National Honor Society t-shirt! Make payments on [mypaymentsplus.com](https://mypaymentsplus.com)

We are building the NHS bulletin board! It'll be finished by 12/2, and starting next semester, every month you can volunteer to help with the word of the month.

Shop with a Wildcat is coming up! Deadline to sign up is 12/6, and you'll need to at least donate $40. More information on our previous post. It's truly a time to give back to your community, and so in the true spirit of NHS, we encourage you all to participate!

As always, make sure to check the spreadsheet in the upper-right corner of the website to make sure your hours are accurate. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to email us! We'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
