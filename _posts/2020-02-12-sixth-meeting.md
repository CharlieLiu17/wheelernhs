title: 12/03 Meeting

**Here's a recap of what we covered on our fourth meeting:**

The main discussion we had was about t-shirts. We held a vote for which t-shirt design we were going to use and had most people to fill out what t-shirt size they were. If you have paid dues *and* you have submitted your permission form, make sure to have this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIzReqK4BYi47NFpXhQlRpNCeEnNC083PbbhC7WhFB3G4W-A/viewform) filled out by the end of the week, or you won't receive a t-shirt. If you didn't have both things done before 12/6, sadly you won't be able to receive one of our custom designed t-shirts :(. 

Shop with a Wildcat is fast approaching, and we want our NHS members to donate materials. You should have let Eric know by 12/6 if you are attending, and if not, do so as soon as possible.
	
Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
