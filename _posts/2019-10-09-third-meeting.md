**Here's a recap of what we covered on our second meeting:**

Only 58% of members have paid dues! Have your dues in by 12/1, and you will be able to receive an National Honor Society t-shirt! Make payments on [mypaymentsplus.com](https://mypaymentsplus.com)

We are building the NHS bulletin board! It'll be finished by 12/2, and starting next semester, every month you can volunteer to help with the word of the month.

Shop with a Wildcat is coming up! Deadline to sign up is 12/6, and you'll need to at least donate $40. More information on our previous post.
Remember, no hours are counted until permission forms are turned in.

Have a great one!
Your NHS Officers
